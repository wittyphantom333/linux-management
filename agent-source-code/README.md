# PatchMon Agent

PatchMon's monitoring agent collects and reports package, system, hardware, and network information to the PatchMon server. It runs as a long-lived service with a persistent WebSocket connection for real-time communication.

## Supported Platforms

**Linux** (amd64, 386, arm64, arm):
- Debian / Ubuntu (apt)
- Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux (dnf)
- Arch Linux / Manjaro (pacman)
- Alpine Linux (apk)

**FreeBSD** (amd64, arm64):
- FreeBSD

## Installation

### Binary Installation

1. **Download** the appropriate binary for your OS and architecture from the releases.
2. **Make executable** and move to system path:

```bash
chmod +x patchmon-agent-linux-amd64
sudo mv patchmon-agent-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/patchmon-agent
```

### From Source

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Go 1.24 or later
   - Root access on the target system

2. **Build and Install**:

```bash
make deps          # Install dependencies
make build         # Build for current platform
sudo make install  # Install to /usr/local/bin
```

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Configure Credentials**:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent config set-api <API_ID> <API_KEY> <SERVER_URL>
```

Example:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent config set-api patchmon_1a2b3c4d abcd1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890 https://patchmon.example.com
```

This saves the server URL to the config file and API credentials to the credentials file, then automatically runs a connectivity test to verify everything is working.

2. **Test Connectivity** (optional, already tested during setup):

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent ping
```

3. **Send Initial Report**:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent report
```

4. **Start the Service**:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent serve
```

The `serve` command is the primary runtime mode. It maintains a WebSocket connection to the server, sends periodic reports on a configurable interval, handles real-time commands from the server, and manages auto-updates.

### Configuration Files

- **Main Config**: `/etc/patchmon/config.yml`
- **Credentials**: `/etc/patchmon/credentials.yml` (600 permissions)
- **Logs**: `/etc/patchmon/logs/patchmon-agent.log`

### Example Configuration File

`/etc/patchmon/config.yml`:

```yaml
patchmon_server: "https://patchmon.example.com"
api_version: "v1"
credentials_file: "/etc/patchmon/credentials.yml"
log_file: "/etc/patchmon/logs/patchmon-agent.log"
log_level: "info"
update_interval: 60
report_offset: 0
skip_ssl_verify: false
integrations:
  docker: false
  compliance: "on-demand"
  ssh-proxy-enabled: false
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `patchmon_server` | PatchMon server URL |
| `api_version` | API version (default `v1`) |
| `credentials_file` | Path to credentials file |
| `log_file` | Path to log file |
| `log_level` | Log verbosity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `update_interval` | Report interval in minutes (synced from server) |
| `report_offset` | Stagger offset in seconds (auto-calculated from API ID) |
| `skip_ssl_verify` | Skip TLS verification (blocked in production) |
| `integrations` | Toggle integrations on/off (synced from server) |

### Example Credentials File

The credentials file is automatically created by `config set-api`:

```yaml
api_id: "patchmon_1a2b3c4d5e6f7890"
api_key: "your_api_key_here"
```

## Usage

### Available Commands

```
patchmon-agent [command] [flags]
```

| Command | Description | Root Required |

| `--log-level <level>` | Override log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |

## Service Mode (`serve`)

The `serve` command is how the agent is intended to run in production. It:

- Maintains a persistent **WebSocket connection** to the PatchMon server
- Sends periodic **package and system reports** on a configurable interval
- **Staggers report times** using a deterministic offset derived from the API ID to avoid thundering herd
- Receives and acts on **real-time server commands** (report now, update agent, toggle integrations, run compliance scans, etc.)
- **Syncs configuration** (report interval, integration status) from the server on startup
- Streams **Docker container events** in real-time when Docker integration is enabled
- Handles **auto-updates** with SHA256 binary integrity verification
- Supports **SSH proxy** sessions when explicitly enabled in config

### Service Management

The agent supports three init systems for service restarts during updates:

- **systemd** (most Linux distributions)
- **OpenRC** (Alpine Linux)
- **FreeBSD rc.d** (FreeBSD / pfSense)

If no init system is detected, it falls back to a helper script for safe restarts.

## Integrations

Integrations are managed from the PatchMon web interface and synced to the agent via WebSocket. They can also be configured manually in `config.yml`.

### Docker

When enabled, the agent collects Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and available image updates. It also streams real-time container status events over WebSocket.

```yaml
integrations:
  docker: true
```

### Compliance Scanning (OpenSCAP)

Compliance scanning supports three modes:

| Mode | Config Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Disabled | `false` | No compliance scanning |
| On-demand | `"on-demand"` | Scans only when triggered from the web UI (default) |
| Enabled | `true` | Automatic scans run with each scheduled report |

```yaml
integrations:
  compliance: "on-demand"
```

When enabled, the agent installs OpenSCAP and SCAP Security Guide content. Available scan tools:

- **OpenSCAP** - CIS benchmark scanning and remediation
- **Docker Bench** - CIS Docker Benchmark (requires Docker integration)
- **oscap-docker** - Docker image CVE scanning (requires Docker integration)

### SSH Proxy

Enables browser-based SSH sessions through the agent. Must be enabled manually in `config.yml` for security reasons -- it cannot be pushed from the server.

```yaml
integrations:
  ssh-proxy-enabled: true
```

## Agent Updates

The agent supports automatic updates with security protections:

- **SHA256 hash verification** - downloaded binary integrity is verified against a server-provided hash before installation
- **Version validation** - the downloaded binary is executed in test mode before replacing the current binary
- **Atomic replacement** - the binary is replaced using `os.Rename` for atomicity
- **Backup retention** - the last 3 binary backups are kept
- **Loop prevention** - a timestamp marker prevents repeated update attempts within 5 minutes
- **TLS enforcement** - `skip_ssl_verify` is blocked in production environments

To manually check for updates:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent check-version
```

To manually update:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent update-agent
```

## Logging

Logs are written to `/etc/patchmon/logs/patchmon-agent.log` with rotation (max 10 MB per file, 5 backups, 14 day retention, compressed).

```
2026-02-18T10:30:00 level=info msg="Collecting package information..."
2026-02-18T10:30:01 level=info msg="Found packages" count=156
2026-02-18T10:30:02 level=info msg="Sending report to PatchMon server..."
2026-02-18T10:30:03 level=info msg="Report sent successfully"
```

Log levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

## Diagnostics

Run comprehensive diagnostics to check agent health:

```bash
sudo patchmon-agent diagnostics
```

This displays:

- **System information** - OS, architecture, kernel, hostname, machine ID
- **Agent information** - version, config file paths, log level
- **Configuration status** - whether config and credentials files exist
- **Network connectivity** - TCP reachability test and API credential validation
- **Recent logs** - last 10 log entries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**:

```bash
# Most commands require root
sudo patchmon-agent <command>
```

2. **Credentials Not Found**:

```bash
# Configure credentials first
sudo patchmon-agent config set-api <API_ID> <API_KEY> <SERVER_URL>
```

3. **Network Connectivity**:

```bash
# Test server reachability and credentials
sudo patchmon-agent ping

# Detailed diagnostics including network info
sudo patchmon-agent diagnostics
```

4. **Package Manager Issues**:

```bash
# Update package lists manually
sudo apt update         # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf check-update   # Fedora/RHEL
sudo apk update         # Alpine
sudo pacman -Sy         # Arch
```

## Uninstallation

Uninstall functionality is handled by the `patchmon_remove.sh` script rather than a built-in command. This ensures clean removal of the binary, service files, crontab entries, configuration, and logs.
